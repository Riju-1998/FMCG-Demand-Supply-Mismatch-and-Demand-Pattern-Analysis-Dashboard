FMCG Demand-Supply Mismatch and Demand Pattern Analysis Dashboard

Overview
This repository contains a Power BI dashboard solution for analyzing demand-supply mismatch and identifying regional demand patterns in the FMCG sector, specifically focusing on an instant noodles business. The objective is to optimize warehouse inventory management and support targeted advertising strategies.

Business Problem
A major FMCG company has been facing significant discrepancies in the demand and supply of their instant noodles across the country.

The dataset includes detailed warehouse and product shipment information, with variables such as:

Warehouse Capacity: Size of each warehouse (Small, Mid, Large)
Warehouse Refill Frequency: Number of refills in the last 3 months
Competitors: Number of competitors in each market
Product Shipped: Tons of products shipped in the last 3 months
Warehouse Location: Urban/Rural, Zones, Regional Zones, etc.
Warehouse Conditions: Transport issues, flood impact, storage issues, etc.
Key Metrics Analyzed
Demand-Supply Mismatch: Analyze where demand is high but supply is low, and vice versa.
